# Resources — talks, writing, books, repos, and war stories

A curated, high-signal reading/watching list from people who ship property-based
and simulation testing in production, plus the field's credibility cases. Each
entry says *why* it's worth your time and what non-obvious technique it
contributes. Pull from here when you want depth on a specific topic or when the
user asks for sources.

## Start here (if you read only three things)

1. **John Hughes — *How to Specify It!*** — the best single resource on the hard
   part (coming up with properties). Five property categories scored against a
   buggy BST. Paper: research.chalmers.se/publication/517894 · talk:
   youtube.com/watch?v=zvRAyq5wj38. This is the backbone of
   `choosing-properties.md`.
2. **Scott Wlaschin — *Choosing properties for property-based testing*** — the
   approachable on-ramp with the sticky pattern names (round-trip, invariant,
   idempotence, …). fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/property-based-testing-2/
3. **David R. MacIver — *How Hypothesis Works*** — how the machinery (generators,
   internal shrinking) actually works. hypothesis.works/articles/how-hypothesis-works/

## Confidence labels

Use these labels when deciding how strongly to recommend a technique:

- **Proven:** broad field evidence, mature tooling, or multiple production war
  stories. Safe to recommend as a default when the system shape matches.
- **Specialized:** solid idea/tooling, but best for a narrower domain or workflow.
  Recommend when the trigger is specific.
- **Emerging:** promising recent research or early practice. Use as inspiration
  or an optional advanced move; do not present it as a settled default.

## 2026 additions worth folding into practice

- **[Emerging] PropGen — LLM-based property generation for mobile app testing**
  (https://arxiv.org/abs/2604.13463). The useful pattern is not "ask an LLM for
  properties"; it is functionality-guided exploration, behavioral evidence,
  property synthesis, and feedback refinement. Evidence: 12 Android apps and 25
  previously unknown functional bugs; promising but narrow. This is the backbone
  of `llm-assisted-property-discovery.md`.
- **[Emerging] PBT-Bench — benchmarking AI agents on PBT**
  (https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.15229; https://pbtbench.com/). Useful for
  evaluating whether an agent can derive documentation-grounded invariants and
  write Hypothesis strategies that actually hit semantic bugs. Treat benchmark
  scores as research signal, not proof that an agent will find bugs in a live
  codebase.
- **[Specialized/Emerging] LLMORPH / NLP metamorphic testing**
  (https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.23611; https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02108). Shows
  metamorphic testing as the practical oracle for LLM/NLP systems and catalogs
  many task-specific metamorphic relations. Treat the *metamorphic testing*
  principle as proven, but the LLM/NLP relation catalogues as domain-specific and
  still maturing.
- **[Emerging] ARMeta — multi-agent metamorphic testing for REST APIs** (arXiv
  2605.28321, https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.28321). Uses OpenAPI plus an LLM
  workflow to derive Given-When-Then metamorphic API scenarios. Use the scenario
  patterns; verify business semantics independently.
- **[Emerging] Gentoo — Fuzzing with Agents? Generators Are All You Need** (arXiv
  2604.01442, https://arxiv.org/abs/2604.01442). The important lesson: agents
  can synthesize target-specific input generators, but only with tooling, source
  context, and coverage/predicate feedback. Evidence is encouraging but limited
  to 7 Java-library fuzz targets and coverage-oriented results.
- **[Specialized/Emerging] DiscPBT — property-based testing for data-intensive
  scalable computing** (https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.11132). Systematizes reusable
  meta-properties for Spark/data systems: equivalence rewrites, data
  decomposition, computation decomposition, and operator-local relations.
  Strongest for Spark/dataflow-like systems, not as a general-purpose testing
  recipe.
- **[Emerging] Programmable Property-Based Testing** (https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18545).
  Points toward decoupling executable specifications from runners so
  coverage-guided seed pools, targeted search, context-sensitive shrinking, and
  custom parallel runners can reuse the same property. Treat as a
  framework-design direction, not a project-testing technique to reach for by
  default.
- **[Emerging] VAFuzz — Variability-Aware Fuzzing** (ICSE 2026). Treats
  configuration as a first-class fuzzing dimension, complementing combinatorial
  input-space coverage. The broader idea "vary configuration deliberately" is
  mature; this specific greybox fuzzing line is newer.

  (custom generators that shrink, stateful modeling, targeted properties) even if
  you don't write Erlang.

  Holler — *The Fuzzing Book*** (open web book). Use for grammar-based fuzzing,
  fuzz drivers, search-based testing, reduction, and symbolic fuzzing examples.
- **Maurício Aniche — *Effective Software Testing***. A pragmatic bridge from
  conventional testing into stronger techniques: boundary analysis, contracts,
  testability, mutation testing, and when property-style tests pay off.
- **Hypothesis documentation** (hypothesis.readthedocs.io). The authoritative
  reference for the modern internal-shrinking model; see `stateful`, `target()`,
  and the example database.

## Exemplar repos (worked examples to imitate)

  generator/shrinker meta-example.

## War stories (the credibility cases)

- **Volvo / AUTOSAR (Quviq).** ~3,000 pages of automotive spec translated into
  QuickCheck models, testing implementations from many vendors → ~200 issues,
  *including bugs in the standard itself*. The flagship industrial PBT result.
- **Dropbox "Nucleus" sync engine.** Two deterministic randomized testing systems
  (CanopyCheck, Trinity), tens of millions of runs nightly, ~100% green on
  master, every failing seed reproducible — the canonical "design for
  testability" story.
- **AWS S3 ShardStore.** Property-based testing with developer-written
  correctness specs plus coverage-guided fuzzing and failure injection, adding
  only ~13% more code; part of AWS's broader deterministic-simulation practice.
- **Anthropic agentic PBT (2026).** Claude autonomously writing Hypothesis tests
  found real, merged bugs across NumPy/SciPy/Pandas and others (e.g.
  `numpy.random.wald` producing negative samples) — and quantified the LLM
  failure modes that shape `choosing-properties.md`.

## What the practitioners converge on (from the field, incl. HN)

The recurring consensus, kept to what isn't already covered elsewhere in the
skill:

- **The hard part is coming up with properties** — overwhelmingly the top-cited
  difficulty. Antidote: think about how a function *relates to other functions*,
  not "properties of `foo`"; treat the property as the function's contract. (This
  is why `choosing-properties.md` exists.)
- **Model-based / stateful testing is where the deep bugs are** — repeatedly
  named the highest-ROI style, including for "business" code people assume PBT
  can't touch.
- **"Non-deterministic test" fear is mostly a misconception** — PBT *is*
  reproducible (seed + shrinking + the failure database); commit the database as
  a ratchet.
- **PBT and fuzzing are converging** — coverage-guided fuzzers (libFuzzer, Go
  native, HypoFuzz) overlap heavily with PBT; the rough split is "fast tests +
  detailed assertions = PBT; long crash-hunting runs = fuzzing."

Ecosystem note for tooling: **Tyche** (tyche-pbt.github.io) visualizes generator
coverage/distribution; **Schemathesis** and **HypoFuzz** extend Hypothesis;
**rapid** (Go), **fast-check** (TS), **CsCheck** (.NET), **clojure.spec +
test.check** (Clojure), **proptest** + **AWS Shuttle** (Rust) are the
frequently-praised picks. Per-language entry points live in `frameworks.md`.
